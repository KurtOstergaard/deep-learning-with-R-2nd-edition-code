## Deep Learning with R, 2nd Edition (Code Only)

The repository contains just the code from the book "Deep Learning with R, 2nd Edition".

You can install all the dependencies by cloning this repo and sourcing the `"install-r-tensorflow.R"` script, 
either at the R console or the terminal:

```bash
Rscript install-r-tensorflow.R
```

Note: the install script assumes that R and CUDA drivers are already installed.
